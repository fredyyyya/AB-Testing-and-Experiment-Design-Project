# AB-Testing-and-Experiment-Design-Project

In this project for the MSBA Big Data course, our group analyzed US traffic accident data from 2016 to 2022. The datasets were too big to be uploaded on GitHub. Their source is from here on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents

We performed EDA on U.S. traffic accident data, conducted A/B tests with propensity score matching on road features and weather conditions' impact on accident severity, duration, and distance affected, and concluded feature importance in accident risk mitigation.
